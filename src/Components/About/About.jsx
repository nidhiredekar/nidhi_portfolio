        I enjoy creating things that are live on the internet. My interest in web development started back   <br />
        in 2020 when I decided to try my hands on Ruby on Rails.Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the   <br />privilege of working at a huge corporation SAP Labs.
        <br />  <br />
        Educational Background :  <br />
        I have done a Master's in Computer Application from the National Institute of Technology, Calicut. 
        <br />   <br />
        I'm open to Job opportunities where I can contribute, learn and grow. If you have a good opportunity  <br /> that matches my skills and experience then don't hesitate to contact me.
